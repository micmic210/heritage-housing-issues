# Heritage Housing Issues

## Introduction
Lydia Doe has recently inherited four properties located in Ames, Iowa, USA, from her late great-grandfather. While she is well-versed in the real estate market of her home country, Belgium, she is concerned that her understanding may not apply to the housing market in Iowa. Factors that increase a property's value in Belgium may not hold the same influence in Ames.

In order to make informed decisions and ensure the best possible return on the properties, Lydia seeks help from a Data Practitioner. Her primary goal is to accurately estimate the value of these homes and avoid financial loss due to mispricing.


## Dataset Content

* The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/housing-prices-data). We then created a fictitious user story where predictive analytics can be applied in a real project in the workplace.
* The dataset has almost 1.5 thousand rows and represents housing records from Ames, Iowa, indicating house profile (Floor Area, Basement, Garage, Kitchen, Lot, Porch, Wood Deck, Year Built) and its respective sale price for houses built between 1872 and 2010.

## Business Requirements

Lydia's objectives for this data-driven project are twofold:

1. She wants to understand which housing attributes most strongly influence sale prices in Ames. To achieve this, she expects clear visualizations that show the correlation between house features and their final selling price.

2. She needs to predict the expected sale price for her four inherited houses based on their characteristics. Additionally, she wishes to use this tool to estimate the price of any other property in Ames she might consider buying in the future.

## Hypothesis and how to validate?

### Hypothesis 1:
Homes with larger overall living areas (`GrLivArea`), higher material quality (`OverallQual`), and newer construction years tend to have higher sale prices.

### Hypothesis 2:
Features such as garage size (`GarageArea`), kitchen quality (`KitchenQual`), and the presence of finished basement areas significantly contribute to the value of a property.

### Null Hypotheses for Statistical Tests:
- **H₀₁:** There is no linear correlation between `OverallQual` and `SalePrice`.
- **H₀₂:** The mean `SalePrice` is the same across different categories of `BsmtExposure`.

### Validation Strategy:
- Perform **correlation analysis** and create **data visualizations** (e.g., scatterplots, heatmaps) to explore relationships between individual features and `SalePrice`.
- Conduct **Pearson** and **Spearman** correlation tests for continuous features (e.g., `OverallQual`).
- Use **one-way ANOVA** to examine differences in `SalePrice` across `BsmtExposure` categories.
- Use **regression modeling** to quantify the impact of specific variables on `SalePrice` and evaluate model accuracy using metrics like **R²** and **RMSE**.
- Test predictions on **Lydia’s four inherited properties** to verify real-world performance and usability.

## CRISP-DM Process Mapping

This project follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework to ensure a structured and business-oriented approach to data science.

---

### 1. Business Understanding

The client, Lydia Doe, has inherited four houses in Ames, Iowa. She seeks to:

- Understand which features most influence a property’s sale price in that region.
- Predict the expected sale price for her inherited homes and other similar properties.

These goals are addressed by delivering a user-friendly, data-driven prediction tool supported by explanatory analysis.

---

### 2. Data Understanding

The dataset used comes from [Kaggle - Ames Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/housing-prices-data), containing approximately 1,500 records of house sales in Ames, Iowa, with 20+ features including:

- Property dimensions (e.g., `GrLivArea`, `LotArea`)
- Quality ratings (e.g., `OverallQual`, `KitchenQual`)
- Year built/remodeled
- Garage and basement details
- Target variable: `SalePrice`

Initial EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) was performed to understand distributions, identify missing data, and explore variable relationships.

---

### 3. Data Preparation

Data preparation steps included:

- Handling missing values (e.g., imputing or removing)
- Encoding categorical features (e.g., `KitchenQual`, `GarageFinish`)
- Scaling/normalizing numeric variables when required
- Feature selection based on correlation with the target variable

A clean dataset was generated for use in regression modeling.

---

### 4. Modeling

Several regression models were evaluated to predict `SalePrice`, including:

- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- Gradient Boosting Regressor  

Model performance was evaluated using:

- **R² Score** (to measure how well the model explains the variance in sale price)
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)

The best-performing model was selected for deployment in the Streamlit app.

---

### 5. Evaluation

Model performance was verified against business expectations:

- The model provides reasonable predictions for Lydia’s inherited homes.
- The most important predictive features aligned with user intuition and hypotheses (e.g., house size, quality).

Visual performance summaries (e.g., feature importance plot, actual vs. predicted price) are included in the dashboard.

---

### 6. Deployment

The final model is integrated into an interactive Streamlit web application that allows:

- Exploratory data insights for the client
- Real-time sale price predictions based on user inputs

The application is deployed via Heroku, making it accessible online to Lydia and potential stakeholders.


## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations and ML tasks

Business Requirement 1:
The client wants to understand how different property features relate to the final sale price.

- Data Visualisation Task:
To meet this requirement, various data visualisations will be used, such as:

  - Correlation heatmaps to identify the most strongly related numerical features.

  - Scatter plots to show how continuous variables (e.g., GrLivArea, GarageArea) influence sale price.

  - Boxplots and bar charts for categorical variables (e.g., KitchenQual, OverallQual).

These visualisations will help reveal patterns, trends, and key influencing factors that determine house value in Ames.

Business Requirement 2:
The client wants to predict the sale price of her four inherited houses and any other similar property.

- Machine Learning Task:
A regression model will be built to predict house sale prices based on selected features. The model will be trained on historical housing data and tested for accuracy using standard regression metrics.

- This model will be integrated into a Streamlit Web App, enabling the user to input house attributes and receive a predicted sale price in real-time.

## ML Business Case

To support the second business requirement, a supervised machine learning regression model will be developed with the following framework:

- Goal:
Predict the sale price of a house in Ames, Iowa based on its attributes (such as living area, build year, quality ratings, etc.).

- Model Type:
A regression model will be used. Several algorithms will be tested (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting), and the best-performing model will be selected based on evaluation metrics.

- Inputs (Features):
Selected numerical and categorical variables that show strong correlation with SalePrice. Examples include:

  - GrLivArea, OverallQual, YearBuilt, GarageArea, KitchenQual, etc.

- Output:
The predicted SalePrice of a given house.

Evaluation Metrics:

- R² Score: Measures how well the model explains variability in the target variable.

- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Indicates average prediction error.

- Comparison of actual vs. predicted prices using visual plots.

Business Impact:
The ML model will help Lydia make informed pricing decisions on her inherited properties and assist in evaluating future investment opportunities. Accurate predictions will reduce financial risk and support data-driven real estate decisions.

### Page 4: Project Hypotheses

This page summarizes and validates the project hypotheses developed during the exploratory data analysis.

- **Hypothesis 1: Property size has a significant impact on sale price.**  
  Analysis of area-related variables suggests that larger properties are generally valued higher.

- **Hypothesis 2: Newer houses tend to command higher prices.**  
  A historical trend analysis shows that recently built homes are often priced above older ones.

- **Hypothesis 3: Kitchen quality is a key factor in pricing.**  
  A strong correlation between kitchen quality and sale price indicates that well-equipped kitchens may increase a property’s market value.
